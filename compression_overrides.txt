# [Per-Texture Compression Overrides]
#
# Line format:
# <filename>=<max texture compression quality level>
# Where <filename> is the path inside the data directory (example: texpages/page-6.png), *case-sensitive*
# Where <max texture compression quality level> corresponds to the following table:
#   0: same as source (for loading a PNG: no gpu texture compression, for loading a KTX2: ASTC4x4 or uncompressed)
#   1: highest quality compressed texture formats only (for loading a KTX2: ASTC4x4 or BPTC, for PNGs: this will still currently lead to uncompressed textures in memory)
#
# To get the default behavior, which is to use the best texture compression format available on a particular system, omit listing the texture filename at all. (This file is intended only for overriding the default behavior.)
# NOTE: This is only intended for compatibility with some old manually-created pixel-art texture atlases that are tightly packed and may have "bleed" issues as a result of texture compression.
# In general, modern texture files with appropriate format, resolution, and padding (if needed between elements) should not need to be listed here, or should be reformatted to avoid it.
